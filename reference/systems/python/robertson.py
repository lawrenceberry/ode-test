    t=0 and alpha distributes the remaining mass between fuel (y1) and product
    (y3).

      * eps > 0 forces the solver to resolve the fastest reaction timescale
        immediately: dy3/dt = k3*eps^2 is large at t=0, so the first step must
        be tiny and the Newton iteration may reject steps before settling onto
        the slow manifold.  The standard [1,0,0] IC has eps=0 and a long
        induction period where only the slow k1=0.04 rate is active.

      * alpha controls how long the stiff phase lasts: high alpha means plenty
        of y1 fuel to keep the reactions running, extending the hard region of
        the trajectory.
