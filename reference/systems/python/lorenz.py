"""Lorenz chaotic system (3D) for solver benchmarks and tests.

Summary:
    dx/dt = σ(y − x)
    dy/dt = x(ρ − z) − y
    dz/dt = xy − βz

with σ = 10, β = 8/3 fixed and ρ as the ensemble parameter (centred at 28,
the standard chaotic regime; chaos onset at ρ ≈ 24.74).

The Lorenz attractor is a strange attractor: trajectories orbit it forever but
never repeat.  The maximum Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.9 means that two initially
close trajectories diverge on a timescale of ~1/λ ≈ 1 time unit, so there is
no meaningful point-wise reference solution after t ≈ 5.

Instead the tests verify attractor confinement: a solver that accumulates too
much integration error leaves the attractor manifold and diverges to infinity,
while a correct solver keeps all trajectories within the known attractor
extent (|x|, |y| < 40, 0 ≤ z < 65 for ρ ≈ 28) even after long integration.
These bounds are the signature of a solver that stays on the manifold.

Parameter perturbations are ±5% around ρ = 28.  All values land in [26.6, 29.4],
well above the chaos onset, so every ensemble member is fully chaotic.

Stiffness properties:
The Lorenz system is nonstiff for ρ ≈ 28, so explicit methods are appropriate.
